## Functional Tests
Functional tests are available in the file [test_system.rs](https://github.com/Alexisdevpro/Threshold-re-encryption/blob/test_feature/code/src/bin/test_system.rs) on the `test_feature` branch. This file contains unit and integration tests to ensure the proper functioning of the various features of the re-encryption system.

## How to Run the Project

To execute a specific file from the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `code_projet/src/bin/` directory:

    ```bash
    cd code_projet/src/bin/
    ```

2. Run the desired file using Cargo:

    ```bash
    cargo run --bin <filename>
    ```

    Replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you want to execute (e.g., `secret_sharing.rs`).

## Setting Up Rust Environment

To set up the Rust environment for this project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Install Rust

If you don't have Rust installed, you can install it using the official installation script:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. Once installed, add Cargo's bin directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

To verify the installation, run:

```bash
rustc --version
```

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alexisdevpro/Threshold-re-encryption.git
cd Threshold-re-encryption
```

### 3. Build the Project

Run the following command to build the project:

```bash
cargo build
```

This will compile the Rust code and generate necessary binaries in the `target/` directory.

### 4. Run Tests (Optional)

To ensure everything is working correctly, run the test suite using:

```bash
cargo test
```

### 5. Docker Support

Coming soon... Next feature 

## Running Tests

The test files are located in the `test_feature` branch. To run the tests, you need to switch to this branch first:

```bash
git checkout test_feature
```
And check README.
